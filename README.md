# bootloader
A sample bootloader code for x86 systems, take it lightly please :)

## Disclaimer (not that I intended to lol)
I'm working on a sample bootloade code, hopefully I can add this as a project to my resume, need to learn x86 asm tho, but how hard can it be?
Anyway let's see what works out, later on you can add your flair to it!
